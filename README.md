# Regression-in-Machine-Learning
In a Simple Linear Regression model, my data is executed with the help of the function and the formulas then
Types Of Regression

1. Simple Regression
I have Taken Two data sets Salary_Data.csv in that I have read the CSV file and did the Training and Testing of the data.
And Continuing with the Training of the model in 5 steps
1. import the model (class) from the package
2. create an object for the linearRegression
3. train the data (find the value of m and c) using the fit method
4. Use predict
5. find the accuracy
Further, I have found the intercepts and coefficients of the model
2. Multiple Linear Regression
In this, I have used the new technique to handle all the nan values and removal of outliers and then performed the regression on it.
3. Polynomial Regression.
